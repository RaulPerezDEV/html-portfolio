<h1>The Best Movies According to Raúl José</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Star Wars III: The Revenge of the Sith</h3>
<p>Best film soundtrack ever, great history and one of the sadest plot twist of the history. Simply perfect!</p>
<h3>Alien</h3>
<p>The best horror film. And it aged very well for a 1979 movie.</p>
<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>All in this movie is amazing. The special effects, the history, the character... All I can say is 'WOW'.</p>
